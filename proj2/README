  1. How to build
Type "make". To clean up and only leave source codes, type "make clean".


  2. How to run
After building, "20141589.out" binary file is generated. That file is the whole sicsim. opcode.txt has to be existent together in same folder. If the opcode.txt has to be switched to another file, change __OPCODE_FILENAME into desired file, and rebuild the sicsim.


  3. Errors
  OUT OF MEMORY BOUNDS
Printed when "dump" is called out of memory. Note that when "dump" is typed, output has default 10 lines.

  MEMORY INSUFFICIENT
Memory allocation for sicsim has failed.

  {{__OPCODE_FILENAME}} NOT FOUND
Text file that opcode is stored is not found.

  COMMAND SIZE IS TOO BIG
Command input is too long to be processed. This can be solved by increasing __CMD_FORMAT_SIZE

  {{__OPCODE_FILENAME}} IS BROKEN
Text file that opcode is stored is not saved properly.

  WRONG INSTRUCTION
sicsim cannot understand the instruction.

  FILE NOT FOUND
File status reading has failed, or file is not existent.

  {{cmd}}: NO SUCH OPCODE
No such opcode is not found in input opcode text file.
